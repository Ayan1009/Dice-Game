            <ul>
                <li>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice. The player may decide to hold the score and change turn or add up with another roll.</li>
                <li>If the player rolls a 1, their current score gets zeroed and the other player takes turn.</li>
                <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.</li>
                <li>If a player chooses to "hold" the current score, their turn total is added to their score and the other player takes turn.</li>
                <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
